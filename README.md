# Skiddle Test

## This test has been created using 

- Next.js
- Typescript
- React Query
- Tailwind
- React icon

I have really tried to focus on the performance of this test. Using server side props i'm able to persist data between pages. Using react query makes it easier to orginise and execute fetch request. It also handles loading data which is returned on the server side. I spent the vast majority of the time on the test making sure the more technical side of this test was right, the structure of data and routes.

## With more time...

I haven't been able to finish all the styling for the inner pages, However the main search page is styled. I used a mobile first approach and a grid to achieve the layout. It would have been great to have been able to add some unit tests and pagination seeing how the offest key is retuened in the data
